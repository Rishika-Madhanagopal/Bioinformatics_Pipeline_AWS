# Bioinformatics_Pipeline_AWS
# 🧬 Bioinformatics Pipeline on AWS

This project implements a complete bioinformatics workflow for genomic data analysis using AWS cloud services. The pipeline performs quality control, read alignment, variant calling, and data analysis using widely-used tools like FastQC, Bowtie2, Samtools, and GATK — all running on an EC2 instance and storing results in Amazon S3.
